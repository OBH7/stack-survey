- Are you more likely to get a job if you have a master’s degree?
- At which companies or roles do developers get paid the most?

## Key Findings

1. **Remote Work and Job Satisfaction**  
   Developers who work remotely tend to have higher job satisfaction compared to those who work in-person or in a hybrid environment. Full remote work yields the highest satisfaction levels.

2. **Impact of Coding Experience on Salary**  
   Developers engaged in entrepreneurial activities like **bootstrapping a business** earn significantly higher salaries than those involved in academic or self-paced learning. Freelancers and contract workers also benefit from diverse experiences.

3. **Most Popular Learning Methods**  
   The most common ways developers learn to code are through **online resources**, including videos, blogs, and forums. Traditional education (university/college) is less popular than flexible, modern learning methods like online courses.

4. **The Role of Education in Employment**  
   Developers with a **master’s degree** have the highest employment rates (84.34%), followed closely by bachelor’s degree holders (81.32%). Those with only secondary education have significantly lower employment rates.

5. **Highest Paying Roles and Companies**  
   - Top roles: **Hardware Engineer** ($236,087), **C-suite Executive** ($230,558), and **Project Manager** ($213,004).
   - Top company size: Developers working for **large companies** (10,000+ employees) earn the highest average salaries ($126,945).
